Things to discuss 
__________________
clone method in object usage and how we can do that
different ways to create an object 
Kibana dashboard in our project and what we can do with that
how we login(Oauth protocol, Authorization, authenctication) happen in systems management
it reads all the registered users from LDAP and use it right?
2 factpr authentication
garbage collection in java, anywhere we are explicitly calling it ?
volatile key word in singleton design pattern
design patterns
code coverage and code quality 
kibana dashboard


clone -> shallow; deep
cloneable interface implement ; override clone method-> throws clonenotsupportedexception
return super.clone
 
emp -> new object creation
-> shallow copy (obj.clone -> reference varaible will be pointed to old object itself, always changes reflect in this object)
-> deep copy -> all together new object will be created, new reference will be created
	
created object -> replica of original object and do some operation on that, 
eg: 
	
Authrorization/Authentication -> LDAP is handling -> authorize and then routed to application
isauthroizedany -> ldap -> add user id
userroleauthroization service -> LDAP user role access view/edit 

stateful/stateless -> SMS ?
2 factor authenication -> keyfob otp, mobile otp 
Garbage collection -> scenario based
	
jacoco plugin and sonar

routing string will be configured based on source and destination will be saved in repository and shown in the 
elastic search -> IDE for kibana

bos team -> communicate -> act software -> 10275 send and 10276 recive 
all details will be sent to another gateway which will be saved in a repository 
-> where kibana acts as an interface to query the details of elastic search query
