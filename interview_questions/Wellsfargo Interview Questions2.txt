1.what are the collection classes you have used in your project
2.when do you use Set
3.How it will avoid duplicates
4.I have Employee class with age and name.I didn't override hashcode() method. I have created 10 employee objects with same age and name values.
How many employee objects will be saved into hashSet.what is the size of the Set
5.I have Overriden hashCode() method and my hashCode() is always returing 1. I have created 10 Employee objects with same Age and name values.
How many employee objects will be saved into hashSet.what is the size of the Set.
6.Can you write a code for good hashCode() and equals()
how HashMap works
7.I have 2 threads - thread1 and thread2.I want my thread1 to print all odd numbers from 1 to 100 and thread2 to print all even numbers.

12.when an object is garbage collected
13.how garbage collection works
14.design pattern used in garbage collection
15.I have created arrayList with size 10 and added 10 elements.I am trying to add 11th element.Can I do that.what will happen internally
16.I have class A and class B extends class A.
class A{
}
class B extends A{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		A a = new A();
		B b = new B();
		A a1 = new B();
		B b2 = a;
		A a2 = b;
	}
}
is there any problem in code.If yes what is the exception you will get.How can you avoid exception.
17.public class DateExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		Date d = new Date();
		modifyDate(d);
		System.out.println(d);
	}

	static void modifyDate(Date d){
		d = null;
	}
}
What is the value of d printed.
18.public class ListExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) {

		List ls = new ArrayList();
		ls.add(11);
		modifyList(ls);
		System.out.println(ls.size());
	}
	static void modifyList(List ls){
		ls.add(22);
		ls.add(33);
	}
}
what is the size of the list
